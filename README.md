# Fraud-Detection-by-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It involves handling class imbalance, feature engineering, and training a Random Forest model to achieve high recall and precision. The final model achieves an F1-score of 0.86, effectively identifying fraud while minimizing false positives.
